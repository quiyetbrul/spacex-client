Live Demo: https://quiyetbrul.github.io/spacex-client/

The app is split out into two folders:
- `spacex-client`: https://github.com/quiyetbrul/spacex-client
- `spacex-server`: https://github.com/quiyetbrul/spacex-server

From within the `start` and `final` directories, there are two folders (one for `server` and one for `client`).

## Installation

To run the app, run these commands in two separate terminal windows from the root:

```bash
cd spacex-server && npm i && npm start
```

and

```bash
cd spacex-client && npm i && npm start
```
